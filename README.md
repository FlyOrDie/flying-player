# flying-player

I wish it would be a great audio(maybe video then) player, made of pure javascript(!!!) which you would like to embed to your website :)

### Installation

You will need to embed a css file in your head section like this:

```html

<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/flyingPlayer.css">

```

and you are also supposed to embed a js file before your body end tag:


```html

<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/flyingPlayer.css">

```

Finally, you need to add this one to your html:

```html

<div id="fplayer"> <!-- Data is supposed to be generated dynamically -->

</div>

```
